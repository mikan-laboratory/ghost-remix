## Local Development

### Mailgun

You don't need Mailgun to get started, but you'll need for email-based workflows like member sign up.

Don't worry about the $35 a month price tag, immediately after signing up for the trial, you can downgrade to the flex plan.

1. Create [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account.

2. Navigate to Sending -> Domains. You should see a test domain that looks like `sandbox1234567890abcdef1234567890ab.mailgun.org`

3. Add your email as an authorized recipient.

4. Scroll down and select API Keys. Create a new API key and copy the key.

5. Find the correct base URL [here](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-intro.html#base-url).

### Basics

1. Create `.env` file in root directory, using `.env.example` as a template.

2. Use `tilt up` to install dependencies, generate a prisma client, and start services.

3. Seed database with button in Ghost section of Tilt UI

   - If you want to inspect the database, you can manually trigger a GUI from the Tilt UI.
