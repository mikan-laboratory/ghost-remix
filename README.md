## Local Development

### Get the code

Use the template to create your own repository.

#### GitHub UI

- Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/mikan-laboratory/ghost-remix), click `Use this template`, and follow the instructions.

#### GitHub CLI

- Get the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the template repository

git clone https://github.com/mikab-laboratory/ghost-remix.git new-project

cd new-project

# Step 2: Create a new repository on GitHub

gh repo create username/new-project --private --source=.

# Step 3: Push the cloned contents to the new repository

git push --set-upstream origin main
```

### Mailgun

You don't need Mailgun to get started, but you'll need for email-based workflows like member sign up.

Don't worry about the $35 a month price tag, immediately after signing up for the trial, you can downgrade to the flex plan.

1. Create [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account.

2. Navigate to Sending -> Domains. You should see a test domain that looks like `sandbox1234567890abcdef1234567890ab.mailgun.org`

3. Add your email as an authorized recipient.

4. Scroll down and select API Keys. Create a new API key and copy the key.

5. Find the correct base URL [here](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-intro.html#base-url).

### Basics

1. Create `.env` file in root directory, using `.env.example` as a template.

2. Use `tilt up` to install dependencies, generate a prisma client, and start services.

3. Seed database with the button in Ghost section of the Tilt UI.

   - The production script seeds an owner and basic settings. The development script includes posts and comments.
   - If you want to inspect the database, you can manually trigger a GUI from the Tilt UI.

4. The Node engine is set to 18.19 in package.json to match the production runtime. This follows the Ghost team's advice. You can find more information [here](https://ghost.org/docs/faq/node-versions/#why-follow-lts). Using a different version locally shouldn't be an issue, but you will see a warning when you run `npm install`. If you want to use this version in development, you can use a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script) to manage multiple Node versions.

### Theme

You can change the theme colors for components in `app/theme/theme.ts`.

### Favicon

You can replace the favicon.ico with your own in the public folder. If you are using a PNG, you will need to add `<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.png" type="image/png" />` to the `<head>` component under `<Meta/>` in the `root.tsx` file. If you are unsure about turning your logo into a favicon, we used [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) to do it for free.

### Pages

Published pages are automatically added to the menu in the navigation bar.

## Test Docker Build

1. Build image and run container with `make all`.

2. Clean image and container with `make clean-all`.

## Deploy to Fly.io

### Prerequisites

1. Create [Fly.io](https://fly.io) account.

2. Authenticate with `flyctl auth login`.

3. Create app with `flyctl launch --no-deploy`.

### GitHub Actions

1. Navigate to the newly created application in the Fly.io dashboard and get a deploy token.

2. Set secrets in GitHub repository settings.

3. Manually trigger by going to Actions tab and selecting `Deploy`. Click `Run workflow` and enter the branch name to deploy.
   - You can update this action to trigger on push to `main` by changing the `on` section of the workflow file to `push: [main]`

### Command Line

1. Set secrets

```
flyctl secrets set GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY="my-api-key-value" \
   OWNER_EMAIL="my-email-value" \
   OWNER_PASSWORD="my-password-value" \
   MAILGUN_DOMAIN="somedomain" \
   MAILGUN_API_KEY="somekey" \
   MAILGUN_BASE_URL="mailgunbase" \
   MAILGUN_USER="postmaster@somedomain \
   MAILGUN_PASSWORD="password" \
   JWT_SECRET="somejwtsecret" \
   SITE_TITLE="My Site" \
   SITE_DESCRIPTION="My website" \
   OWNER_NAME="Admin" \
   OWNER_SLUG="admin" \
   BLOG_URL="https://mysite.com" \
   COMMENT_SETTINGS="all"
   LLM_URL="https://mysite.com"
   LLM_API_KEY="somekey
```

2. Deploy

```
flyctl deploy
```

### Custom Domains and SSL

More details [here](https://fly.io/docs/networking/custom-domains-with-fly/)

1. List your app ip addreses with `flyctl ips list`.

2. Create SSL certificates.

```
flyctl certs create mysite.com
flyctl certs create www.mysite.com
```

3. Use the ipv4 address to create an A record in your DNS provider, and the ipv6 address to create a AAAA record. Create a CNAME record for `www`.

## RapidRead

- Add `RapidRead` with [GoGemma](https://github.com/mikan-laboratory/go-gemma), a small Golang server with Redis we developed that leverages Google's Gemma 2B for quick summarization on minimal hardware.
